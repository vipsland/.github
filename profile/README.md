All succeeding NFTs are developed from the original root blocks using blockchain technologies.


**How are the unique hash names and eDNA for the NFT calculated?**

Each NFT‚Äôs name is a hash derived from 1024 (32√ó32) pixels with maximum of 216 colors each. The color codes are numbered 0 to 215, in the byte array of []byte{n1,n2,n3‚Ä¶,n1024} where n denotes the numeric value of color codes.

<pre>
var nft [1024]byte; 
hashCode := fmt.Sprintf("%x",blake3(nft)[:8]);
</pre>

The hash code is generated using the first 8 bytes of the returned blake3 algorithm, with a possibility of 1.8446744 x 10^19 results, which is represented in hexadecimal value.

Each of the membership pass on VIPSLAND NFT has such value written below which is represented in human readable 3x3pixel font.
